# Extremely-Below-Zero
Extremely Below Zero is a 2D pixel-art platformer where you get to manipulate time.

You play as Bob, a regular guy who does nothing but play video games all day. One day, the evil Dr. Dave, CEO of Nano Corp. broke into Bob's house and stole his donuts! Bob wanted revenge, but he didn't have any powers, so he gave up all hope of ever seeing his donuts again. Meanwhile, a commercial on TV was advertising a time warping watch for just 3.99$! He bought the watch, found Dr. Dave's headquarters to be located in Antarctica and infiltrated it to get back his precious donuts.

The game will be available to play in your browser using HTML5 and downloadable as executable binaries.

This game was made for a school project. The games title may or may not have been inspired by SUPERHOT.
